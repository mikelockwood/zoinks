Version 0.3.3 (May 15, 2003)

	Added new file/directory diff feature:
	
	The "Compare Files..." menu item in the "File" menu brings up a dialog for specifying which two files or directories you want to compare.
	Files are compared side by side.  You can copy differences from one file to the other, and can edit within the files at the same time.
	There is a menu item that allows you to recompute the differences between the files (which can be useful if you edit directly in one of the files).
	Comparing directories gives you a tree view of the files that differ.  
	Clicking on a file in the tree brings up a file compare window to allow you to merge the changes for that file.
	
	From the command line, you can type:
		
		zoinks -d <file1> <file2> 
		
	or:
		zoinks -d <directory1> <directory2> 
		
	to compare two files or directories.  This can be used with source control systems
	(for example, Perforce users can set P4DIFF to "zoinks -d" to use zoinks diff with Perforce).
	
	Also fixed:

	- Fix focus problem when pasting text into a text field.
