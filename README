All rights reserved.


Zoinks is a text editor and IDE for Unix/X11 platforms.  There is also an integrated source level debugger
under development (not included in this distribution).  Zoinks also has some support for HTML editing.

For more information, or to download the latest version of Zoinks, see https://github.com/mikevoydanoff/zoinks.
See the ChangeLog file for the latest changes.


Licensing & Distribution:

Zoinks is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  See the file COPYING in this directory for details.


Requirements:

Zoinks builds on Unix/Posix platforms (Linux, BSD, etc).  To build zoinks you need to have X11 and the libXPM library.
Virtually any Linux distribution should have this.  libXPM might need to be installed on other platforms.

Zoinks also uses Imlib as an option.  Imlib is used to autmatically calculate the width and height of images when using the
"Insert Image" command for inserting HTML "<img>" tags.  Imlib support can be disabled using the "configure --disable-imlib" option.

Zoinks uses the GNU gettext for localization support.  If you have trouble building and you do not need a localized
version of Zoinks, try the "configure --disable-nls" option.

To build zoinks, do the usual:

	./configure
	make

The program will be built as ide/zoinks

Optionally:

	make install

will install zoinks as /usr/local/bin/zoinks (unless you pass a different --prefix option to configure).
